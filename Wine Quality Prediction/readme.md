# Wine Quality Prediction
Data set can be accessed from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality).

## Data Set Information
The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

## Attribute Information
### Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
- fixed acidity
- volatile acidity
- citric acid
- residual sugar
- chlorides
- free sulfur dioxide
- total sulfur dioxide
- density
- pH
- sulphates
- alcohol
### Output variable (based on sensory data):
- quality (score between 0 and 10)
